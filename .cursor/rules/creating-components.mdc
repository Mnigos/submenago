# Creating components

- Always wrap components in Readonly
- Do not use `React` namespace, just use named export fe. use `ReactNode` instead of `React.ReactNode`
- Always use `PropsWithChildren` react type util when declaring children prop.
- Prefer inline export instead of exporting at the end of the file.
